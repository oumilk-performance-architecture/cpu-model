# CPU Model (RISC-V)

### Cycle accurate performance model 

### Prerequisites
 * C++ compiler
 * CMake

### Build the Project

```bash
❯ rm -rf build && mkdir build
❯ git submodule init && git submodule update
❯ cd build
❯ cmake ..
❯ make && make install
❯ cd ..
```

##############################################################

 1. A tiny **static library** `lib/libdivision.a`,
 2. **A command line binary `bin/divider`**, which links with the library,
 3. **An executable unit test** `bin/divider_tests`  using [Google Test library](https://github.com/google/googletest).
 4. **An optional BASH build script** `build-and-run` that you can use to quickly test if the project compiles, and runs.

## Usage


#### Git Clone

First we need to check out the git repo:

```bash
❯ mkdir ~/workspace
❯ cd ~/workspace
❯ git clone \
    https://github.com/kigster/cmake-project-template \
    my-project
❯ cd my-project
❯ bash build-and-run
```

The output of this script is rather long and is shown [on this screenshot](doc/build-and-run.png).

The script `build-and-run` is a short-cut — you shouldn't really be using this script to build your project, but see how to do it properly below.

#### Project Structure

There are three empty folders: `lib`, `bin`, and `include`. Those are populated by `make install`.

The rest should be obvious: `src` is the sources, and `test` is where we put our unit tests.

Now we can build this project, and below we show three separate ways to do so.



#### Running the tests

```bash
❯ bin/divider_tests
[==========] Running 5 tests from 1 test case.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 5 tests from DividerTest
[ RUN      ] DividerTest.5_DivideBy_2
[       OK ] DividerTest.5_DivideBy_2 (1 ms)
[ RUN      ] DividerTest.9_DivideBy_3
[       OK ] DividerTest.9_DivideBy_3 (0 ms)
[ RUN      ] DividerTest.17_DivideBy_19
[       OK ] DividerTest.17_DivideBy_19 (0 ms)
[ RUN      ] DividerTest.Long_DivideBy_Long
[       OK ] DividerTest.Long_DivideBy_Long (0 ms)
[ RUN      ] DividerTest.DivisionByZero
[       OK ] DividerTest.DivisionByZero (0 ms)
[----------] 5 tests from DividerTest (1 ms total)

[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 5 tests from 1 test case ran. (1 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 5 tests.
```

#### Running the CLI Executable

Without arguments, it prints out its usage:

```bash
❯ bin/divider

Divider © 2018 Monkey Claps Inc.

Usage:
	divider <numerator> <denominator>

Description:
	Computes the result of a fractional division,
	and reports both the result and the remainder.
```

But with arguments, it computes as expected the denominator:

```bash
❯ bin/divider 112443477 12309324

Divider © 2018 Monkey Claps Inc.

Division : 112443477 / 12309324 = 9
Remainder: 112443477 % 12309324 = 1659561
```


```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <division>

Fraction       f = Fraction{25, 7};
DivisionResult r = Division(f).divide();

std::cout << "Result of the division is " << r.division;
std::cout << "Remainder of the division is " << r.remainder;
```

## File Locations

 * `src/*` — C++ code that ultimately compiles into a library
 * `test/lib` — C++ libraries used for tests (eg, Google Test)
 * `test/src` — C++ test suite
 * `bin/`, `lib`, `include` are all empty directories, until the `make install` install the project artifacts there.

Tests:

 * A `test` folder with the automated tests and fixtures that mimics the directory structure of `src`.
 * For every C++ file in `src/A/B/<name>.cpp` there is a corresponding test file `test/A/B/<name>_test.cpp`
 * Tests compile into a single binary `test/bin/runner` that is run on a command line to run the tests.
 * `test/lib` folder with a git submodule in `test/lib/googletest`, and possibly other libraries.
